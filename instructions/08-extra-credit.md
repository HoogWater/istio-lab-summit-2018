# Congratulations!

If you've made it this far, congratulations! You've learned the basics of the service mesh
concept using OpenShift and Istio.

But you've only scratched the surface of the power of the service mesh for your containerized
applications on OpenShift. For a more in-depth journey with Istio and OpenShift, Please
visit the online tutorial [Learn Istio on OpenShift](https://learn.openshift.com/servicemesh),
which is available 24 hours a day and provides a much more comprehensive set of exercises
that cannot be covered in the short time we have today.

Congratulations on making it this far and we hope you enjoy the rest of Red Hat Summit 2018!
