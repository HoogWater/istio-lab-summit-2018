# Introduction and Setup

![Istio Logo]({% image_path istio-logo.png %})

Istio is an open platform to connect, manage, and secure microservices. Istio provides an easy way to create a network of deployed services with load balancing, service-to-service authentication, monitoring, and more, without requiring any changes in service code. You add Istio support to services by deploying a special sidecar proxy throughout your environment that intercepts all network communication between microservices, configured and managed using Istioâ€™s control plane functionality.

Follow the steps below to get started with this lab!

### Fetch connect script

First, open a terminal and run the following commands:

~~~sh
cd
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jamesfalkner/istio-lab-summit-2018/master/scripts/connect.sh
~~~

### Find your hostname

Your hostname for this lab is `{{ISTIO_LAB_HOSTNAME}}`.

### Execute connect script

To connect to your provisioned lab machine, run the following command:

~~~sh
bash connect.sh {{ISTIO_LAB_HOSTNAME}} ~/.ssh/summit_lab_rsa
~~~

Your lab environment pre-defines several environment variables and adds Istio your `$PATH`. Confirm they
are set correctly:

~~~bash
echo Istio Home: $ISTIO_HOME && \
echo Istio Lab Content: $ISTIO_LAB_HOME && \
echo Istio Lab Content: $ISTIO_LAB_HOME && \
echo Istio Lab Project Name: $ISTIO_LAB_PROJECT && \
echo Path: $PATH
~~~

### Start OpenShift and install Istio

~~~sh
sudo -E -i
cd $ISTIO_LAB_HOME
./scripts/start.sh
~~~

After the start script completes, you are ready to move on to the first exercise! Good luck!

### Opening more Terminals

If you need to open up more terminal windows during the lab, you'll again need
to use `ssh` to connect to the environment before executing commands in the exercises:

~~~bash
bash connect.sh {{ISTIO_LAB_HOSTNAME}} ~/.ssh/summit_lab_rsa
~~~

Then:

~~~bash
sudo -E -i
cd $ISTIO_LAB_HOME
~~~

## Congratulations!

In the next step we'll use Istio to intelligently route traffic. Click **Go To Next Module** to continue!
