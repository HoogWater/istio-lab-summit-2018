# build all required container images for various labs

# push them to docker hub with a convenient tag to be referenced during lab

# The following docker images are needed for this lab:
# recommendation:v1
# recommendation:v2 (returns a different response string from v1 to differentiate it at runtime)
# recommendation:v2d (introduces 3 second delay in Vert.x code)
# customer:v1
# preference:v1
