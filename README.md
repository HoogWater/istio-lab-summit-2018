# Getting Hands On With Istio on OpenShift
## Red Hat Summit 2018

As microservices-based applications become more prevalent, both the number of and complexity of their interactions increases. Up until now much of the burden of managing these complex microservices interactions has been placed on the application developer, with different or non-existent support for microservice concepts depending on language and framework. The service mesh concept pushes this responsibility to the infrastructure, with features for traffic management, distributed tracing and observability, policy enforcement, and service/identity security, freeing the developer to focus on business value. In this hands-on session you will learn how to apply some of these features to a simple polyglot microservices application running on top of OpenShift using Istio, an open platform to connect, manage, and secure microservices.
